                that they will enjoy and that are also high in calories and nutrition. Foods that require no refrigeration, water,
                special preparation, or cooking are best.</p>

            <p>The non-governmental organisation BRAC has been working alongside local government since the beginning of the recent
            flood situation in the country. The organisation has allocated BDT 3 crore from its own funds for emergency flood
            relief. The money will be used to provide dry food, safe drinking water, oral saline, matches, candles, essential
            medicines and other services to people affected by flood.</p>
